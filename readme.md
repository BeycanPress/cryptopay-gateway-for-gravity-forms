### What does this plugin do?

For some processes on your WordPress site, you may be using Gravity Forms to collect data from your users or sell products. If you want to get paid in FIAT coins as well as cryptocurrencies through Gravity Forms, you have found the right plugin. Because CryptoPay is a plugin developed entirely for WordPress and supports 15+ WordPress plugins in addition to Gravity Forms.

So CryptoPay is the ideal plugin to receive crypto payments on forms created with Gravity Forms.

### How does it work?

First of all, you need to know that this is an integration plugin. So it does not have a standalone function. This plugin needs CryptoPay or CryptoPay Lite to work. You should also have Gravity Forms installed on your website.

### Usage

After installing Gravity Forms, CryptoPay and Integration plugin, you need to create a CryptoPay feed for the form from the form settings you created with Gravity Forms.
